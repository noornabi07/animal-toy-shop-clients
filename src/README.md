* My Live Website Link: 
* My Project name is Animal Toys Shop
* First I created Header Footer Navbar and 2 additional sections.
* Shown by creating sub category section and loading data from mongodb server according to category.
* For this I created server site and used mongodb.
* Each toy is shown, along with their details, in a separate route.
* I have created a section to add toys, where anyone can add toys by logging into the site.
